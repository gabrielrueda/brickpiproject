# University of Windsor Computer Science Co-op Projects
These are the projects created in Gabriel Rueda and Antonio Iatonna's University of Windsor Computer Science Co-op Placement from Fall 2019 to Winter 2020. 

### Projects
##### Capture the Flag
- Combines both Object Avoidance and Line Following projects to play a 1v1 capture the flag game with another robot
- The robot includes a flag that the robot can grab the flag and return to it's base
- The CaptureTheFlag_Final folder contains the final version

##### Object Avoidance
- The robot has a moveable head in order to check both front, left and right of itself
- The robot ensures that it has moved past the obstacle before continuing to move forward

##### Line Following
- Uses a colour sensor to detect a coloured line on the board
- Is able to follow both curved and straight lines

##### Bluetooth Testing
- Attempted to use PyBluez to synchronize robot movement
- Decided to use Paramiko SSH instead to synchronize the robot movement.

### Technologies
- Python
- BrickPI3
- Paramiko
- SSH Clients
